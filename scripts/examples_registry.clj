;; Single source of truth: bb.edn's :init requires this instead of inlining the
;; vector, and raygui-examples/project.clj's :profiles must agree with it.
;; Profile equals name for every row here.
;;
;; Descriptions are capped at 49 characters — see `check-descriptions`, which
;; bb.edn's `examples` task runs so the cap is enforced rather than remembered.
